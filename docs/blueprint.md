## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated blue (#3498DB) to reflect trust and reliability, commonly associated with educational platforms.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F2F5), a desaturated version of the primary, which ensures readability and reduces eye strain during prolonged use.
- Accent color: Purple (#9B59B6), an analogous color to provide a different shade without disrupting the visual harmony of the interface. Should be less saturated than the primary.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a modern sans-serif suitable for both headlines and body text for readability.
- Clean and responsive design using a grid system to ensure optimal viewing experience across different devices. Tables should have clear column headers and easily accessible filter options.
- Consistent use of minimalistic icons to represent different actions and categories. Use a single style throughout to keep consistency.
- Use subtle animations for data loading, form submissions, and notifications. This will provide a smoother and more engaging user experience.
